                <h2>Pugs: The Lovable Little Companions</h2>
                <p>Pugs are known for their charming personalities, unique looks, and playful nature. With their wrinkled faces, big round eyes, and adorable snorts, they quickly win hearts wherever they go. Originally bred in ancient China as royal companions, these little dogs are full of character, and they love being around people. Despite their small size, pugs have big personalities and are known for being affectionate, loyal, and often a bit silly. Whether they're curled up on the couch or following you from room to room, pugs are happiest when they're by your side, making them perfect family pets and loyal friends.</p>
